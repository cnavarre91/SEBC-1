Â As explained in mails to Michael my environment is a lost cause.
 
 According to Michael I'll spend my time working with a partner (corin.navarre@sdggroup.com) from the Kerberos implementation on.
 So the activity of tomorrow will be performed with Corin.
 
 So I'll upgrade the documentation of the previous days (just before Kerberos).
 
 Sorry for the inconvenience.
