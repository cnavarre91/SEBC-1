Â As explained in mails to Michael my environment is a lost cause.
 
 According to Michael I'll spend my time working with a partner (corin.navarre@sdggroup.com) from the Kerberos implementation on.
 So the activities of tomorrow Thursday will be performed with Corin.
 
 So I'll upgrade the documentation of the previous days (just before Kerberos).
 
 Sorry for the inconvenience.
 
 Last update: Kerberos finally properly runs in Corin env.
 Tmorrow and as there's an activity that needs of clean machines so I'll continue by myself.
